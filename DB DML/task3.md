1. Write the insertion (deleting or updating if needed) scripts for adding records to the tables in your DB. Each table has to be filled with at least 10 records.
2. Upload the file with the script.
3. Execute SELECT statement (with JOINs if needed) in order to show the results of insertions. Make the screenshots with results and upload them to this directory.
